# HTSP VLC Module

Trying to revive the code in order to integrate it natively in VLC, VLC for iOS/tvOS and VLCKit Applications.

After watching the FC Bayern vs. Real Madrid soccer game on 4/19/17 and experience the difference in quality 
between http (vlc) and htsp (kodi) streaming I decided to pursue this project.

Thank you, BtbN for the awesome work so far.

-------------------------------------
## Legacy Notes.

Compile using make and put resulting libhtsp_plugin.so somewhere VLC finds it.

Some settings are available for the service discovery. Filter advanced settings for HTS to easily find them.

URL format is htsp://{username{:password}@}server{:port}/channelId

The Service Discovery module is listed under LAN and grabs the channel list from TVH.
